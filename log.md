# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 1: October 27, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Started with **arrays** in **Data Structures and Algorithms**.\
                     Also, learned **C++ STL-vectors, maps and sets** since most of the problems I encountered required vectors.
                                          
**Link(s) to work**
1. [Sort an array of 0,1 and 2](https://github.com/Rakhi-Pundhir/100daysofcode/blob/master/day1_a.cpp)
2. [Remove duplicates from a sorted array](https://github.com/Rakhi-Pundhir/100daysofcode/blob/master/day1_b.cpp)
