# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 1: October 27, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Started with **arrays** in **Data Structures and Algorithms**.\
                     Also, learned **C++ STL-vectors, maps and sets** since most of the problems I encountered required vectors.

### Day 2: October 28, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Problem Statement : **Given two sorted arrays, merge them into one sorted array in constant space**\
                      At first, I couldn't find a method to solve this in O(1) space but later resolved it and realized that whenever we need to solve a task in constant space or optimal time we can make use of pointers.her, we are taking three pointers one at end of first array, the other at end of second array and the third one at the end of total size of first array.Then we start comparing values pointed by the first two pointers and the greater one is placed at the position pointed by the third pointer.At last we come to the beginning of the array which is sorted.
